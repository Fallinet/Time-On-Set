# Time-On-Set
New ass rhythm game basiclly like DDR, Step Mania, or FNF


Yuh
You should know how to play those kinds of games and this game is no different
Just made with some C# and Unity

I do not plan on making a massive amount of updates
I will attempt to make an update check for it though so you don't have to keep downloading the game over and over from this github page


Most if not all of the music is original in there own way and most likly made by me
**P.S. I suck at music**

We going nowhere with this one

Time On Set

Another Fucking Rhythm Game

That No One Asked For
